# Works
1. We collected and filtered our own dataset consisting of images of cars and logos of 14 brands in India.
2. Retrained the inception-v3 model separately for the brands and stored their weights giving an accuracy of approximately 80% for each brand.
3. Used Hog filter and SVM to train the logos achieving an accuracy of 88%.
4. Used sliding windows for recognizing logos of cars in a given image.
